## Problem Description:

The objective is to create a comprehensive relational database for an emergency healthcare clinic dedicated to providing critical medical services. The database must efficiently manage patient information, medical staff, administrative staff, emergency records, equipment, facility details, insurance and billing, emergency contacts, scheduling, security, training, and incident reporting. Patients are linked to their records, medical staff to patients, administrative staff to billing and appointments, emergency records to patients and staff, equipment to facilities, insurance and billing to patients, emergency contacts to patient records, scheduling to patients and staff, and security to staff records. The database aims to streamline data management, reporting, and operational needs in this healthcare setting.

## Data Dictionary:
## Queries:
### Query 1:
Lists the total cost of each medication with the most expensive medication at the top and the least expensive at the bottom. This query allows managers to see which medications are the most expensive so they can properly prescribe patients to ensure their healthcare will be able to cover the expense. This also can help doctors determine if there is a cheaper option that they may be able to substitute for the patient.
